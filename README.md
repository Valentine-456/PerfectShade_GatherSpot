## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python + Django
- **Frontend:** JavaScript/TypeScript + React
- **Project Management:** Jira (for time estimation, sprint planning, and task tracking)
- **Version Control:** GitHub (for code collaboration and repository management)

  - **Frontend Developers:** Develop UI components and handle API integration
  - **Project Managers:** Oversee project timeline and ensure deliverables are met

## System Architecture
GatherSpot follows a **client-server architecture** to ensure scalability and efficiency. It consists of:
- **Client:** A React-based frontend that handles user interactions and renders event-related data
- **Server:** A Django backend that processes client requests, manages business logic, and interacts with the database
- **Database:** Stores user information, events, tickets, and reviews
- **Google Maps API Integration:** Enhances event discovery by visualizing event locations

- Verify organization accounts

## API Endpoints
The system utilizes a **RESTful API** over HTTPS, with messages structured in JSON format.

### Key Operations
- **Account Management:** User authentication (signup, login), profile updates, and account deletion
- **Event Management:** Create, modify, delete, and promote events
- **Discovery & Search:** Search for users and events with filtering options
- **Notifications:** Receive updates on events, friend requests, and invitations

## Development Setup
### Prerequisites
- **Backend:** Python 3.x, Django
- **Frontend:** Node.js, npm/yarn, React
